Building a valuable network amplifies your knowledge and opportunities, with μLearn's growing community serving as a significant asset for connections.

- **Garden / Forest Mindset: Building things that sustain** <br>
Unlike a garden that relies on a gardener, μLearn aims to be a self-sustaining ecosystem, growing organically like a forest through community collaboration and open-source principles.
